### ***Why I am here?***

*I majored in Electrical Engineering, but it was not my thing...<br>*
*Crypto trading makes me want to code something useful.<br>*
*So I started coding without knowing anything, the **`binance-liquidation-telegrambot`**, as you can see.<br>*
*It was coded with chatGPT, but I learned and felt so much doing it, totally changing my perspective.<br><br>*

*And I found the **'Samsung SW Academy for Youth'**.<br>*
*I applied for an internship, and I had a great experience for two weeks.<br>*
*Even after the internship, I'm still studying.<br><br>*

*Hope to be a good developer...<br>*
